# Triple A Catering🍛

**Triple A Catering** is a dedicated web platform designed to establish a digital presence for a premier Nigerian catering service in Tameside, Manchester. This project bridges the gap between authentic African cuisine and the local community, serving as the primary touchpoint for customers seeking home-style cooking.

The platform focuses on accessibility and brand identity, ensuring that the rich culinary heritage of Nigeria—featuring staples like Jollof Rice, Ayamase, and Pounded Yam—is presented in a modern, appetite-inducing format. It transforms a local catering service into a searchable, verifiable digital entity.
